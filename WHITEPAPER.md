# Encralink Whitepaper

## Introduction
Encralink is a decentralized, client‑side encrypted messaging and document sharing platform.  
It combines **TweetNaCl** for local encryption, **IPFS** for decentralized storage, and **Solana** for on‑chain logging and fee capture.

## Value Proposition
- 🔐 Privacy: All encryption happens in the browser, no plaintext leaves the client.
- 🌐 Decentralization: Messages and documents pinned to IPFS with redundant gateways.
- 🪙 Transparency: Transaction hashes logged on Solana for proof of delivery.
- 📈 Tokenomics: Fees fuel buybacks and weekly token locking to strengthen the ecosystem.

## Technology Stack
- React + Vite frontend
- Supabase for database and edge functions
- TweetNaCl for encryption
- Solana Web3.js for blockchain logging
- IPFS gateways for storage

## Token Utility
- Fees collected (0.001 SOL per log) are used for token buybacks.
- Weekly token locking after buybacks ensures scarcity and community trust.

## Roadmap
See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed milestones.
